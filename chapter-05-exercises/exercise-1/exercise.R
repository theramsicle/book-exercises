# Create a variable `hometown` that stores the city in which you were born

hometown = 'Kansas City'

# Assign your name to the variable `my_name`

my_name = 'Ben'

# Assign your height (in inches) to a variable `my_height`

height = 76

# Create a variable `puppies` equal to the number of puppies you'd like to have

puppies = 2

# Create a variable `puppy_price`, which is how much you think a puppy costs

puppy_price = 400

# Create a variable `total_cost` that has the total cost of all of your puppies

total_cost = puppies * puppy_price

# Create a boolean variable `too_expensive`, set to TRUE if the cost is greater 
# than $1,000

too_expensive = FALSE

# Create a variable `max_puppies`, which is the number of puppies you can 
# afford for $1,000

max_puppies = 2
